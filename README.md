This repository is one of my projects as part of my internship at Bharat Intern - **The Word Nerd.**

**The Word Nerd** is basically a blog website where users can post, update, comment and share their blogs on various social media platforms. All of this can be done once user creates their account on the website while viewing a blog is free to surf through. 

This repository contains 2 branches - Frontend and Backend for better understanding of the schema of the project.

To run this project, you will have to seperately run frontend using the script - npm start and for backend - nodemon server.js.
